# NBitpayClient

A non-offical and Bitpay API compatible client library.

## How to use

You can reference the package with [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NBitpayClient), and use the `Bitpay` class.

Please, check and run the [NBitpayClient.Tests project](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitpayClient/blob/master/NBitpayClient.Tests/Program.cs#L97), as a working example.
For the example to work, you need a fully synched Bitcoin Core Testnet node, then modify your settings [here](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitpayClient/blob/master/NBitpayClient.Tests/Program.cs#L20) for the test to work.
